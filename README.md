You need to have python installed.

To find out which version was used for each project, just consult the **.tool-versions** file.

I used the **asdf** version manager. <br>

Configure Python Virtual Environment:

[Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

You must install the required libraries for each project, if necessary.

For that, just:

```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to execute:

```py
python main.py
```
